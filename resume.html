      <div class="exp-role">Staff Software Engineer</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Lead a team of 8 engineers owning federated product and infrastructure for Institutional APIs and administration tools serving thousands of customers, including every major crypto ETF, handling approximately 1 billion requests per month.</li>
        <li>Identified and drove consolidation of duplicated Institutional FIX trading infrastructure owned by a neighboring team, over initial resistance from stakeholders who preferred independent systems. Addressed concerns by designing multi-tenant configuration support, resulting in a simpler system with fewer resources and half the maintenance toil.</li>
        <li>Drove API standards and initiatives across 12 subteams, establishing consistency for institutional-facing services.</li>
        <li>Designed and built a novel indexing system for cross-organization financial data.</li>
        <li>Expanded connectivity options for institutional customers across REST, FIX, and PrivateLink. Automated all certificate lifecycle management, eliminating manual cost and error.</li>
        <li>Migrated administration workflows from a bespoke solution to a company-wide standard, simultaneously resolving maintenance cost and critical security requirements.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Led a team of 9 engineers building provisioning infrastructure for TPU AI accelerators across dozens of clusters of ~1,000 nodes each, globally distributed across 4 continents, serving hundreds of customers including every major AI lab.</li>
        <li>Partnered with compute, runtime, and product teams to deliver functional requirements for external product launches, including new TPU generations.</li>
        <li>Identified that the existing framework for long-running asynchronous provisioning operations was a systemic drag on development velocity, requiring extensive manual change management and causing frequent backward compatibility errors. Made the case for a replacement to the original framework's authors, who became meaningful collaborators. The resulting transpilation framework in Go doubled development productivity in half the code.</li>
        <li>Owned project priorities, mentored new team members, and reviewed design and code across the team.</li>

Orchestrated complex multi-team data migrations, schema changes, backfills, and indexing.</li>
        <li>Led development of a common model lifecycle API for deployment, canarying, and rollback across continuously deployed models, reducing deployment complexity and improving model iteration velocity organization-wide.</li>
        <li>Built end-to-end model monitoring: UI surfaces, out-of-the-box metrics, and declarative metrics APIs, giving ML engineers visibility into model health from training through production.</li>
